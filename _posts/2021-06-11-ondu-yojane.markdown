**Description:** New system to improve the agriculture production, marketing and delivery system.

**Introduction:** The intention of this paper is to develop a new model to handle and improve the agriculture practices, the (selling?), marketing, transportation of various agricultural products in India. For this the basic idea is to integrate different sectors into one single organize that handles all these stages. This can result in improvement of the agriculture field as overall, also improve the profit the farmer gets for their crops and transform agriculture as a viable career for any newcomer.

<p align = "center"> Fig 1: This picture shows the initial plan of how the organization would look like and be setup. </p>

**Acchakannada:**

This is the parent organization. Here we are the kings and whatever we say is final. [1] <br>
**Research Wing:**
This constitutes of three smaller Units.
   - Agricultural Research: This team will be involved in doing new research related to food crops, agricultural methods, new tools that other countries are using, getting knowledge from other places and customising for our needs. Identify methods to what crops are good for what areas, control the crops that are grown and the amount in which they grown, team up with MBA to learn market needs. <br>
   - MBA - Market and Business A(some acronym needed) : This team will be involved in finding out the best way to manage our organisation, activities, develop or customise solutions to improve our operations. Do market research for our agricultural products. <br>
   - Technology Team: This team will handle any software and hardware requirements that are needed for our organisation and agricultural activities at primary. (ಗುದ್ಲಿ, ಸಲಿಕೆ, ಪಿಕಾಸಿ, ಬುಟ್ಟಿ ಇತರೆ).<br>

 **Implementation Wing:** <br>
 - Farmers will be made members of this organization. Those who become members will get benefits of getting correct market pricing for their products, no necessary to deal with middle men (obviously we are the new middle men now, but more sophisticated with shoki). Non members are not accepted here. Also members are free to sell elsewhere as initial offer. (loophole, needs improvement).
 - Any research methods, efficient methods brought up and approved by research wing will be implemented in the identified areas.<br>
    - New irrigation methods will be implemented to support new agricultural practices where needed.<br>
    - Members can sell to our units and get money instantly.
    - Crops are divided in 3 category based on quality.
    - Grade A, Grade B, Grade C.
    - Price range decided for crops will based on which quality category they fall into, and then farmers are given the prices.
    - If they are not satisfied with the prices, they are free to sell elsewhere. (loophole, needs improvement).
- Transportation team will then take these to their pre identified destination as decided from market research and management teams. (also some to our homes).
- Finance and Accounts team will facilitate the smooth operation between and all units.

**Conclusion:** <br>
After implementing and doing all this, if then too farmer’s problems aren’t solved,  Then nothing can solve their problems.
